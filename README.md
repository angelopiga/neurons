the codes main.ipynb simulate the growth and dynamics of a 2D neuronal culture. 
fluo_from_binar_spikes.m convert the binar spikes from main.ipynb in calcium fluorescence traces.

The dynamics of each neuron follows Izhikevichâ€™s integrate-and-fire model, 
with the addition of a pre-synaptic depression dynamics accounts for neurotransmitter depletion following repetitive firing
